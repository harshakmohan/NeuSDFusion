# MLP for SDF Prediction from Predicted Tri-Plane

# We represent the geometry of a 3D shape using three
# axis-aligned planes, i.e. the XY, YZ, and XZ planes. We then use a multi-layer
# perceptron (MLP) to decode the tri-plane into signed distance values

# In this file, define the MLP that'll convert the latent tri-plane representation into an SDF.
# After converting to SDF, we'll use marching cubes algorithm to generate a mesh.
